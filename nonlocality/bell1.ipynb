    "## Symmetries of the outcomes of a measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by studying the symmetries of a single measurement on a quantum system. Let us say that the measurement has outcomes $a = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetry group\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in relabelings of these outcomes; those relabelings are represented by permutations. The group of all permutations of $k$ elements is the symmetric group of degree $k$, written $S_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the motivation, see our [paper on the symmetries of nonlocality in the context of device-independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01833). See also the [description of the symmetric group on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, there are different ways of writing elements of a symmetric group. RepLAB chooses to write down the permutation as the image row vector. For $\\pi \\in S_5$, we write $\\pi = [\\pi(1), \\pi(2), \\pi(3), \\pi(4), \\pi(5)]$ (using square brackets to distinguish this notation from the cycle notation), which corresponds to the *one-line notation* of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Notations .\n",
    "\n",
    "For the group axioms, Wikipedia has a [compact discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) . When composing permutations, one needs to decide, for $\\pi, \\sigma \\in S_k$, how to compute the product $\\pi \\cdot \\sigma$. We make the choice of having $(\\pi \\cdot \\sigma)(a) = \\pi ( \\sigma (a))$, which corresponds to a left action, i.e. $\\sigma$ is applied first. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Composition_of_permutations for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice of composition corresponds to standard notation used in physics; however computational group theory uses a right action convention, most of the time using the *exponent notation*. Those notation choices should not concern the RepLAB user, as we made sure that the software uses consistent notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we construct the symmetric group $S_5$. The object `S5` we construct knows how to compose permutations, when they are written using row vectors of integers in Matlab/Octave. The composition example is the one from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group#Multiplication), and we check that we recover the same results."

We also check how the representation looks in that invariant subspace."

    "The presentation above glossed over an important concept: the decomposition of a representation into irreducible subrepresentations is essentially unique, up to the degeneracy afforded by multiplicities. Indeed, when several copies of the same representation appear, the decomposition into irreducible subrepresentation is not exactly unique; refer to the end of Chapter 2 of the book by Jean-Pierre Serre cited in the preface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the method `dec.irrep(i)` needs to be replaced by `dec.irrep(i,j)` where $i$ is the index of the irreducible representation type, and $j$ is the copy index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if one works using real representations, there could be a difference in the irreducible decomposition when the representation is treated as a complex one. This is because the real field is not algebraically closed. Over the reals, there are three kinds of irreducible representations: RepLAB identifies and puts them in a canonical representation. Not to worry: representation of symmetric groups and derivatives (direct products and the like) are decomposed the same way over the real and complex numbers."
